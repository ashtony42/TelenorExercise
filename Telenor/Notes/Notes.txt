Randomization in tests is taboo and can lead to flakes.
I reccomend not using it for the Bredband Address Search

This test could be made more efficient by skipping the home page's navigation 
and navigate directly to the Bredband page

Navigation tests should be their own family of tests to assert that each navigation link works

Does this website use a microservice architecture where different pages are managed by different teams?

Randomization issue to report:
-Sometimes, the 5g product, in fact, does not appear
  -Instead, a prompt for choosing your apartment number is selected
  -This is due to one of the random locations, in fact, having multiple appartments to choose from
  -This is another reason why you don't do randomization, but instead create a separate scenario.

TODO:
- I have also discovered these types of address fields exist, these should have tests too.
  - Entrance
  - Floor
- Plead to developers to add ID's to elements for testability
